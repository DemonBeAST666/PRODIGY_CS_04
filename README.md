# PRODIGY_CS_04
This project demonstrates a basic keylogger integrated with a login page using Python (Flask) and JavaScript. The goal is to understand how keystrokes can be captured and logged for educational and cybersecurity research purposes.
✨ Features
✅ A simple login page designed with HTML & CSS
✅ Captures username and password input from users
✅ Uses JavaScript fetch API to send credentials to a Flask server
✅ A Python keylogger to log keystrokes in the background
✅ Stores logs securely in a file or sends them via email for analysis

🚀 How It Works
The login page collects user credentials and sends them to a Flask-based server.
The Python keylogger runs in the background, recording all keystrokes.
The Flask server logs the captured data in a file for further analysis.
(Optional) The logs can be emailed for monitoring purposes.
🛠 Technologies Used
Python (Flask) – Backend server to handle logging
Pynput – To capture keystrokes in Python
JavaScript (fetch API) – Sends login credentials to the server
HTML & CSS – Frontend design
